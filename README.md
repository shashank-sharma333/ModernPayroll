# Introduction to ModernPayroll

Current payroll systems facilitate the transfer of money between the employer and the employee in specific currency only. 
With an increase in remote work culture, there is a need for making a universal payment mechanism, irrespective of the currency. 
Our goal is to build a payroll system that pays the employees in cryptocurrency 
Instant global transfers of cryptocurrency hold an edge over legacy bank transfers, with an internet connection the only prerequisite to acquiring a digital wallet for receiving payments
